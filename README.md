# SurgiLook.ai

SurgiLook.ai is webapp that uses a generative model designed to create realistic before and after images of cosmetic surgery. This tool serves as a visualization aid for doctors and patients to anticipate the potential outcomes of a surgical procedure before it takes place.

## Overview

SurgiLook.ai leverages existing models from Hugging Face, a renowned AI research organization specializing in natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. This model utilizes state-of-the-art technology to generate images that simulate the before and after effects of cosmetic surgery.
